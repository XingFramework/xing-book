# Creating The Application

## Insalling the Xing Framework rubygem

We'll start by installing xing-framework. Make sure you're using a compatible version of Ruby (we prefer >= 2.2).  If you're using a Ruby manager with gemsets (like RVM), you probably want to [create a gemset now](https://rvm.io/gemsets/basics) and switch to it. If you're not using gemsets, don't worry about it.
