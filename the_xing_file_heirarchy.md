# The Xing File Heirarchy

Before we start developing data resources, let's take a moment to become familiar with how files are laid out in a Xing project.  We're going to elide some of the gritty details for now and just give you a rough overview.

The most important subdirectories in this list are ```frontend``` and ```backend```. 

## backend

The backend subdirectory contains the Rails application. To a large extent, it is just a standard Rails application without any views.  Inside the backend directory, all your standard Rails and rspec commands are available:  database rake tasks, rake routes, rspec <path>, etc.

As with any Rails project, your code will primarily go in backend/app/ and backend/lib/.  Xing uses rspec by default, so specs are in backend/spec/.

## frontend

The frontend subdirectory contains the AngularJS application and its build products.  Your code will all go in frontend/src/, and in general you shouldn't need to touch frontend/bin, frontend/build, frontend/karma, or frontend/node_modules: these are either generated by the build process or by NPM.

frontend/build.config.js and frontend/config/* are involved with configuration of the JavaScript and Compass build processes.
