# Sample Data

We're not going to build the resources for creating and editing our projects just yet, because we'd like to get to the frontend so you can have a working application to look at.

But we'd like to have some projects in our database when we get there. Fortunately the Xing includes a standard pattern for creating rake tasks that generate sample data: synthetic, randomized data you can use to view and demo your application as if the database were already populated by users.
