# Where to Report Issues

Xing is composed of many submodules, both NPM modules and Ruby gems.

We are working on a permanent solution and architecture for problem reporting and communication.  For now, all issues with Xing (including bugs, suggestions, etc.) should be reported to one of two places:

* The GitHub issues page for the individual gem or module, if the issue clearly affects only one subcomponent of Xing. (See the [XingFramework GitHub organization](https://github.com/XingFramework))
* [The GitHub issues page for the xing-framework rubygem](https://github.com/XingFramework/xing-framework), if the issue affects the overall framework or framework integration.

At present, the latter gem is primarily just the new application generator, but because of the name we will use it as the clearinghouse for framework issues.
