# The Xing Origin Story

All the creators of Xing work (or have worked) at [Logical Reality Design](https://LRDesign.com), a small web development agency. We've been doing web development for seventeen years, and we used Ruby on Rails as our primary tool for the last seven. 

Two years ago, we could see  massive changes on the horizon for web applications. After years of relying on the server to do heavy lifting, the browser is taking over as the web's main application platform. As a company, we decided to dive in to this new direction head first.

As it turned out, our plan to build a Javascript based client that talked to an API only server was a bit more difficult than we'd planned. We'd chosen what we thought were the best tools. But we discovered tools that worked well in isolation did not always work together. The complexity of development seemed to increase exponentially. We found ourselves re-solving problems whose solutions we'd taken for granted for years. And we weren't the only ones. Talking to other experienced developers, it seemed everyone was struggling. And new developers were completely lost; the barrier to entry that Rails helped lower had raised right back up.

Xing represents two years of efforts to clear these paths, so that other folks don't have to. After two years of growing pains, we're pretty happy writing applications with it. We just released the first large commercial application written in the framework. Xing is our most ambitious technical project to date and making it at times drove us a bit mad. But we made it so that other companies like ours can easily build amazing web applications. We offer it to small teams of developers so they can compete with much larger teams. And we offer it to new developers as a life raft in a sea of complexity.
