# The Xing Origin Story

All the creators of Xing work (or have worked) at [Logical Reality Design](https://LRDesign.com), a small web development agency in Pasadena, California. Our company is scrappy and a bit quirky, and we're full of people who are passionate about the art of coding. We've been doing web development for two decades, and we used Ruby on Rails as our primary tool since 2006. 

## Moving Beyond Rails

In 2014, our toolset for building server-side Ruby on Rails applications had become mature. But we could see that massive changes were on the horizon. For the web to truly succeed, developers must embrace the browser as the web's application platform. As a company, we decided to dive in to this challenge head first.

## Making a Frontend and a Backend Work Together

As it turned out, our plan to build a JavaScript based client that talked to an API server was a bit more difficult than we'd planned. We'd chosen what we thought were the best tools for the job. But we quickly discovered tools that worked well in isolation did not always work together. The complexity of development seemed to increase exponentially. We found ourselves re-solving problems whose solutions we'd taken for granted for years. And we weren't alone. As we went to meetups, we found other experienced developers were struggling to figure things out. And new developers were completely lost; the barrier to entry that Rails helped lower raised right back up.

Xing represents two years of efforts to clear these paths, so that other folks don't have to. After two years of growing pains, we're pretty happy writing applications with it. We just released the first large commercial application written in the framework. Xing is definitely our most ambitious technical project to date and making it at times drove us a bit mad. But we made it so that other companies like ours can easily build amazing web applications. We offer it to small teams of developers so they can compete with much larger teams. And we offer it to new developers as a life raft in the sea of complexity that is modern web development.
